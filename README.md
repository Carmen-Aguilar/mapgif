# How to make a gif of a map

Prior to the UK local elections in May 2019, Sky News was shared a database with historic local results since 1973.

That data shows that the two main parties control three-quarters of the councils, what is one of the highest rate of dominance for the last 46 years. It also told us that the LD gains affect positively the number of councils without overall control by any party, and [we told our results in this story](https://news.sky.com/story/local-elections-see-how-your-area-has-voted-over-the-past-40-years-11707933).

We also offered the possibility of searching for a particular local authority and see how each area has voted over the past 40 years (scroll down in the previous link).

And to promote the story, I played with `ggplot` and `gganimate` to produce a gif map, although it is particular tricky this kind of visualisations in the UK due to boundary changes. 

Here is [my "how I did it" R Notebook](http://rpubs.com/Carmen_Aguilar/gif_map_localelections).
