# How to make a gif of a map

Prior to the UK local elections in May 2019, Sky News was shared a database with historic local results since 1973. 

We analysed that data [here](https://news.sky.com/story/local-elections-see-how-your-area-has-voted-over-the-past-40-years-11707933), showing the prevalece of two-party in the last years and the relationship between the Liberal Democrats and the number of council without overall control by any of the parties.

We also offered the possibility of searching for a particular local authority and see how each area has voted over the past 40 years (scroll down in the previous link).

To promote the story, I played with ggplot and gganimate to produce a gif map, although it is particular tricky this kind of visualisations in the UK due to boundary changes. 

Here is [my "how I did it" R Notebook](http://rpubs.com/Carmen_Aguilar/gif_map_localelections).
